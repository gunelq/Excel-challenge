Homework for Module 1-Excel

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, i will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Steps: 
1. Conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live
2.  New calculated  column called Percent Funded- to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
3.  Conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200
4. New columns:average donation, Parent Category, Sub-Category
5. Create pivot table and graphs  based on Parent Category, Sub category , outcome
6. Two new columns for data and change the format of data using formuls
7. Create a new table, use formulas to add data
8. Statistical Analysis. The mean number of backers, The median number of backers, The minimum number of backers, The maximum number of backers, The variance of the number of backers, The standard deviation of the number of backers
